## My process

### Built with

-HTML
-JS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This challenge is I think the most complicated code that I've do because of the button and the transition of pages(ratingpage to TYpage).
This challenge deepens my understading of JS DOMS and active selector although I don't use active selector to this challenge but I try hard  and spends so much time using it but it's not succesful cause I can't make the buttons functional when I use active selector, It seems to me that the code is all correct but I still can't work it so I try different approach.This is what the function I want in the button that I can't work it, if I clicked any of the buttons the buttons that I picked will turn the background orange but if I hover the other button it will still turn white from default background.I dont remove the js code that I try to make it work so if you have time you can check it and I will so much appreciated if you explain to me why it's not working.

And also I learned how to use the pixel perfect extension so it's more pixel accurate than most of my past challenge.so this is all the list of what I learned to this challenge:

-addEventListener
-active selector
-mouseover
-mouseout
-DOM
-IDs tags

### Continued development

My goal for now is to know What is the problem of my code when I use active selector, And of course still improve my HTML,CSS and specialy Javascript.
